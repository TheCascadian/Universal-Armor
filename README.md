Craft armor out of nearly anything in the game. Dirt chestplates. Diamond ore boots. Compressed obsidian leggings if you are running Universal Compression alongside this.

## What It Does

Universal Armor generates full armor sets (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots) for nearly every item and block in your instance. Same crafting recipes as vanilla armor. Same durability scaling logic. Just more.

*   **No upfront configuration required.** Every block and item from every installed mod is supported automatically at startup.
*   **Vanilla recipe parity.** If you know how to craft iron armor, you already know how to craft this.
*   **Compressed armor tiers.** If Universal Compression is active, compressed blocks can be smithed into progressively denser armor sets. Requires both mods installed; compressed armor does not exist otherwise.
*   **Runtime recipe generation.** No datapack bloat. No manual JSON wrangling. Recipes are built virtually at startup.

Requires NeoForge 1.21+. MIT licensed.
